# 2048
This 2048 game has been developed from the inspiration of famous game [2048](https://play2048.co/). The main language of the game is Java. During the development of the game I got to learn about many things design patterns like `Singleton Instance` and Java GUI libraries like `java applet` and `java swing`. 

**This game is compatible with Java 7 or above.**
